<h1>Applying filters to SQL queries</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focused on using SQL filtering techniques to extract targeted and actionable insights from a database, supporting the team in addressing security concerns and streamlining computer updates. The objective was to retrieve specific employee, machine, and departmental data relevant to ongoing investigations and updates. The project involved crafting precise SQL queries to identify failed login attempts after business hours, login attempts on specific dates, and logins originating outside of Mexico. Additionally, data for employees in the Marketing, Finance, and Sales departments, as well as those outside of the IT department, were retrieved. This approach ensured that the filtered data was relevant, accurate, and aligned with the investigation and update requirements.
